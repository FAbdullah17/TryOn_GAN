## Introduction

![System Architecture](sample_images/img1.png)

The **Virtual Try-On System** is an advanced AI-powered solution that enables users to visualize clothing items on themselves digitally. Using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **human parsing**, and **garment warping**, the system processes two images:

1. **Person Image** - An image of a person wearing an outfit.
2. **Garment Image** - An image of a different outfit only.

The system then generates an output image where the person appears to be wearing the new outfit.

This technology is highly relevant for e-commerce, fashion design, and augmented reality (AR) applications, as it enhances customer experience, reduces return rates, and provides scalable solutions for retailers.

## Project Scope & Importance

### Scope
- **End-to-End AI Pipeline** - Covers data preprocessing, model training, inference, and real-time deployment.
- **Advanced Deep Learning Techniques** - Implements **GANs** for image synthesis, **TPS warping** for garment alignment, and **ResNet-based human parsing**.
- **Scalability** - Optimized for **GPU acceleration** and cloud deployment.

### Importance
- **E-Commerce Impact** - Reduces return rates by 30-50% by allowing customers to try clothing virtually.
- **Cost Efficiency** - Eliminates logistical costs of physical try-ons and sample production.
- **Innovation** - Provides a digital platform for **fashion designers** to prototype their outfits virtually.

## Key Uses & Components

### Key Applications
- **E-Commerce Platforms** - Integrates with online stores for virtual dressing rooms.
- **Fashion Design Studios** - Enables rapid prototyping of new designs on digital models.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR)** - Can be extended to mobile/AR glasses for in-store experiences.

### Core Components
1. **Human Parsing Module** - Segments body regions (skin, hair, clothes) using a **ResNet-based** segmentation model.
2. **Garment Warping Module** - Aligns clothing to body pose using **Thin Plate Spline (TPS) transformation**.
3. **GAN Generator** - A **U-Net architecture** that synthesizes the final try-on image.
4. **PatchGAN Discriminator** - Ensures image realism by evaluating synthetic outputs against real ones.
5. **FastAPI Backend** - Enables real-time image processing and serving through a web API.

---

## System Architecture

The Virtual Try-On system follows a structured workflow:

1. **Image Preprocessing** - Resizes images to 256x256 and normalizes them.
2. **Human Parsing** - A segmentation model isolates body parts to facilitate garment placement.
3. **Garment Warping** - Uses TPS transformations to warp the clothing image based on keypoints.
4. **Image Synthesis** - The **GAN generator** fuses parsed human features and warped garments.
5. **Adversarial Training** - The **PatchGAN discriminator** validates the realism of the generated image.
6. **Post-Processing** - Converts tensors to **RGB images** and applies denormalization.
